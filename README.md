# simple_rmi_application
This is a simple RMI application developed for testing purposes

This application is supposed to be composed of 3 tiers:

1. Client tier, makes requests via RMI
2. DataServer tier, makes receives RMI requests, runs the code and eventually talks to a database
3. Database, this is on the todo, not yet implemented
